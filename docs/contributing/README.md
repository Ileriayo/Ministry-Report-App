# Contributing

I've tried to make the project as simple and accessible to everyone: developers, translators and users alike. The project grows in quality and features through your feedback and support, so please do reach out to me whenever you have a new feature request, or when you find a bug, and we as a team will get it squashed as soon as possible.

**Here are a few ways you can contribute to the project:**

## Donate/Sponsor

This is an open that's open to most. Even the smallest donation can help the project thrive and keep the website running. I didn't think I would ever reach my Firebase Hosting limits until I released this project, and it makes me both worried and happy.

If you would like to support the development and uptime of the project, you can donate through Open Collective, which is a recognized non-profit organization that funnels in donations only to those who are verified. For example, every time you donate, I get the money only after I show an invoice related to the project expense. So you have complete transparency in where your money is going.

## Find & Report Bugs

This is quite possible the easiest of the options, other than donating. All you have to do is keep using the app and if you run into any trouble, just let me know by raising an issue on GitHub. The progress of fixing that bug can be tracked from there.

## Request New Features

Something that's missing on the app that's halting your progress from making the best version of your resume? Let us know and we'll try and implement that for you. GitHub's Issue Tracking System is pretty flexible when it comes to things like these, so all you need to do to suggest a new feature is raise an issue on GitHub with the Feature Request template.

## Translation

Translating the app into your language has never been easier. Thanks to [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/), a localization management tool, anyone can translate strings without having to mess arounf with a bunch of files. For information on how to translate the app into your own language, please visit the [Translation Secion](/translation/) of the documentation.

## Commit Code

If you are a developer, and a ReactJS developer at that, then you're in demand! Take a look at the code and see how you can make it better, cause I definitely would have made a lot of mistakes. You can setup test cases or extract a particular section of code into a function to improve code reuse. All you need to do is fork the repository on GitHub, make your changes and submit a Pull Request for the same and we'll review it.
