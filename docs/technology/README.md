# Technology

A credit to all the projects and open source packages that have helped during the building of this project. Truly, without these projects, Reactive Resume wouldn't exist.

## ReactJS + Hooks ðŸŽ‰

React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Design simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes.

Hooks solve a wide variety of seemingly unconnected problems in React that weâ€™ve encountered over five years of writing and maintaining tens of thousands of components. Whether youâ€™re learning React, use it daily, or even prefer a different library with a similar component model, you might recognize some of these problems.

## VuePress

VuePress is what made this documentation possible, with it's clean design and quick setup as well as the ability to use markdown to generate content, VuePress seemed like the best way to set up a cleaner documentation.
