# Deployment

You've built the source code successfully and now you're on your way to deploying the app. There are some methods setup to deploy a version of the app without even having to build the source, so we'll run through all the steps here:

## Deploying to Heroku

Heroku is a cloud platform that lets companies build, deliver, monitor and scale apps â€” we're the fastest way to go from idea to URL, bypassing all those infrastructure headaches.

## Deploying to Netlify

Used by more than 800,000 web developers and businesses, the Netlify platform provides modern build workflows, serverless functions and a global Application Delivery Network to deliver the most performant, secure and scalable websites and applications.

## Deploy to Shared Hosting/VPS

Here, you're kinda on your own as there are no one-click buttons to help you through, but it's a simple process. Once you've built the app, you can copy the contents of the `build` folder to your `public_html` folder and you will have the app running on your designated domain or IP address.
